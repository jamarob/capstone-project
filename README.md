## Jotter

Jotter is a mobile **note taking app** and my capstone project from the [neuefische bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/).

Instead of relying on sorting notes into hierachies, **Jotter** makes heavy use of _taging_ (like Twitter) and _fuzzy searching_.

A live demo is available [here](https://capstone-note-app.firebaseapp.com).

To test the latest version clone this repo and run

`npm run start`

in your terminal.
